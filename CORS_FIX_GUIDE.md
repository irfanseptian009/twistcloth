# Firebase Storage CORS Fix Guide

## Problem
The application is experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when uploading files to Firebase Storage from `http://localhost:5173`.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced Upload Function
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Improved error handling for CORS-related issues
- Sequential upload instead of parallel to avoid overwhelming the server
- Better file name sanitization to avoid special characters

### 2. Fallback Upload Strategy
- Primary upload tries the normal path
- If CORS error occurs, fallback method tries alternative approach
- Uses different metadata and upload strategies

### 3. CORS Configuration File
Created `cors.json` with proper configuration for localhost development.

## Manual CORS Setup Instructions

If the automatic setup doesn't work, follow these manual steps:

### Option 1: Using Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `twistcloth`
3. Navigate to Cloud Storage > Browser
4. Click on your storage bucket
5. Go to the "Permissions" tab
6. Add the following CORS configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": ["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:3000", "https://twistcloth.web.app"],
    "method": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600,
    "responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "Authorization", "Range"]
  }
]
```

### Option 2: Using Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `twistcloth`
3. Go to Storage
4. Click on "Rules" tab
5. Make sure the rules allow uploads from authenticated users

### Option 3: Using gsutil (if available)
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://your-actual-bucket-name
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try creating a new product with images
3. Check the browser console for any remaining CORS errors
4. If errors persist, try the manual steps above

## Alternative Workaround

If CORS issues persist, consider:
1. Using a different image hosting service temporarily
2. Setting up a proxy server for development
3. Using Firebase hosting for development instead of Vite dev server
